# **Insurance Cost Prediction - Regression Models**  

This project implements **popular regression methods**, evaluates their performance, and selects the **best-performing model** to predict **insurance costs** based on user input.  

## **üìÇ Project Files**  
- **`insurance_cost_prediction.ipynb`** ‚Äì A **Jupyter Notebook** containing the **full step-by-step implementation**, including **data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation**. Ideal for understanding every step of the process.  
- **`insurance_predictor.py`** ‚Äì A **compact Python script** that functions as an application. It takes **custom user input** and predicts **insurance costs** using the trained model.  

## **‚ö° How It Works**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The project **trains multiple regression models** to find the best fit.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The selected model is then used to **predict insurance costs** based on user-provided data.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Users can run the **Python script** to input their own details and get predictions.  

Both versions of the project provide insights into how **regression techniques** can be applied to real-world scenarios.
