# insurance-cost-regression
A project that implement some popular regression methods, finds the best among them, and builds a model to predict the insurance cost for a person.
This project includes both a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and a Python script (.py) version of the codebase:

Jupyter Notebook: This consists of the complete project. Best fitted to view every steps involved

Python Script: This is a compct version of the notebook. This works like an application that takes custom input from the user and predicts the result using the model trained.
