# insurance-cost-regression
A project that implement some popular regression methods, finds the best among them, and builds a model to predict the insurance cost for a person.
This project includes both a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and a Python script (.py) version of the codebase:

Jupyter Notebook: The notebook format is ideal for showcasing the project’s workflow, as it allows each step’s output to be immediately visible and includes inline documentation, making it easier to follow the analysis and logic.

Python Script: The .py file provides a clean, linear script of the entire project, which can be useful for running the code quickly without requiring a Jupyter environment. This version is more portable and compatible with various development setups and IDEs, offering flexibility if you’re interested in automating parts of this project or running it in different Python environments.
